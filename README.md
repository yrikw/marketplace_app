# T2A2 - Marketplace Project
## Problem

Nowadays people stays at home longer than before because of COVID-19 pandemic. People enjoys coooking at home and have a home kitchen garden. However, there is no platform they can share their home grown vegetables, furits and other food.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?
Globally, the amount of food waste is about 1.3 billion tons. If annual production is about 4 billion tons, about one-third of that amount is discarded. This serious problem is not only for restaurants and shops but also at home. 
People sometimes throw food away even if the food is not expired or uneatble.
The goal of this project is to reduce food waste at home. It will also helps people making a connection in a local community.
