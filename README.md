## Problem
Thesedays people stays at home longer than before because of COVID-19 pandemic. People enjoys coooking at home and have a home kitchen garden. However, there is no platform they can share their home grown vegetables, furits and other food.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?
- Major Problems for food waste acordding to [Australian government](https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/waste/food-waste#:~:text=Food%20waste%20is%20also%20a%20major%20problem%20in,five%20per%20cent%20of%20Australia%E2%80%99s%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.)
1. Each year there is about 7.3 million tonnes of food waste - this is eaquls to 300 kg per person
2. Food waste costs the economy about $20 billions each year
3. Food waste accounts for more than five per cent of Australiaâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions
<br>
Globally, the amount of food waste is about 1.3 billion tons and One third of the world's food is wasted. This serious problem is not only for restaurants and shops but also at home. <br>
People sometimes throw food away even if the food is not expired or uneatble. There is no platform they can share their homemade food or homegrown vegetables and fruits. <br> 
The goal of this project is to reduce food waste at home. It will also helps people making a connection in a local community.

## ERD

## Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app

## Detail any third party services that your app will use

## Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other

### Listing 
Listing has relations with category, measurement, order and user.
To make an item list, user needs to choose one category and one measurement, so listing can not be created without them. "has_many" is used for category and measurement because they can have many items for each colums. If a user deletes a listing item, the related data has to be also deleted from category and measurement tables. 
``` class Listing < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :category
  belongs_to :measurement
  belongs_to :user
  has_one_attached :picture
  has_one :order, dependent: :destroy
 ```
 ```
 class Category < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :listings
end
```
 ```
 class Measurement < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :listings
end
```
### User
User can have only one profile in this applicationn and they can create many listing items. The profile has to have a user and locaton has to have a profile. "has_one" is used for profile and location, so user can have only one profile and one location. 

``` 
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :profile
  has_many :listings
end
```
``` class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_one_attached :picture
  has_one :location
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :location
end
```
``` 
class Location < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :profile
end
```

### Order
Order "belongs to" user and listing, so the data which is stored in order table can relate user_id and listing_id, so administrator (or someone who has right to access) can see who purchased which items. 

```
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :listing
end
```
