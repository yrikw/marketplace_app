# T2A2 - Marketplace Project
## Problem
Thesedays people stays at home longer than before because of COVID-19 pandemic. People enjoys coooking at home and have a home kitchen garden. There are many platforms for cloth, furnitures and more. However, there is not such a specify platform they can share/sell their home grown vegetables, furits and other food. Also, for some marketplaces the user doesn't have to have a proper profile, so there are many untrustworthy accounts, so people who wants to sell their vegetables or fruits, they have to go to market or sell to restaurants or delis. Those actions are not easy for most of people.  

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?
There are Problems for food waste according to [Australian government](https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/waste/food-waste#:~:text=Food%20waste%20is%20also%20a%20major%20problem%20in,five%20per%20cent%20of%20Australia%E2%80%99s%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.)
1. Each year there is about 7.3 million tonnes of food waste - this is eaquls to 300 kg per person
2. Food waste costs the economy about $20 billions each year
3. Food waste accounts for more than five per cent of Australiaâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions
<br>
As I discussed there is no platform for seller to sell home grown vegetables, so people sometimes throw food away even if the food is not expired or uneatble. 
The food waste is one of the global problem and we need to work on it as a personal and community. 
The goal of this project is to reduce food waste at home.  It will also help accelerate local trade market and revitalises local economy.

## Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app

## Detail any third party services that your app will use

## Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other
In this project, there are listing model, category model, measurement model, user model, order model, profile model and location mode. In those models, there is defined how to make relations between different databases and also the data should be stored. For example, user can have many listing items. Listing item is included category and measurements. When the user wants to delete the item, the data in category and measurement should be deleted too. However if the models don't have relationships each other, we have to write a code for each database so to define the relationship makes  code simpler and easier. For user, user can have one profile and location belongs to the profile. If we use "accepts_nested_attributes_for", it allows to save profile data and location data in the same view. 

- User
``` 
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :profile
  has_many :listings
end
```
- Profile
``` 
class Profile < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_one_attached :picture
  has_one :location
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :location
end
```
- Location
``` 
class Location < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :profile
end
```
- Listing

``` 
class Listing < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :category
  belongs_to :measurement
  belongs_to :user
  has_one_attached :picture
  has_one :order, dependent: :destroy
end
 ```
 - Category
``` 
class Category < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :listings
end
```
- Measurement
 ```
class Measurement < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :listings
end
```
- Order
```
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :listing
end
```



## Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application
## ERD

### Listing 
Listing has relations with category, measurement, order and user.
To make an item list, user needs to choose one category and one measurement, so listing can not be created without them. "has_many" is used for category and measurement because they can have many items for each colums. If a user deletes a listing item, the related data has to be also deleted from category and measurement tables. 

### User
User can have only one profile in this applicationn and they can create many listing items. The profile has to have a user and locaton has to have a profile. "has_one" is used for profile and location, so user can have only one profile and one location. 



### Order
Order "belongs to" user and listing, so the data which is stored in order table can relate user_id and listing_id, so administrator (or someone who has right to access) can see who purchased which items.
